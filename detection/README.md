The detection challenge uses synthetic object images rendered from CAD models as the training domain and real object images from the COCO dataset as the validation domain.

## Downloading Data

By downloading these datasets you agree to the following terms:

### Terms of Use
- You will use the data only for non-commercial research and educational purposes.
- You will NOT distribute the images.
- The organizers make no representations or warranties regarding the data, including but not limited to warranties of non-infringement or fitness for a particular purpose.
- You accept full responsibility for your use of the data.

You can download source and target datasets with 
    
    wget http://csr.bu.edu/ftp/visda17/det/train.tar
    wget http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/train2017.zip
    wget http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2017.zip
    
You might also want to download files containing ground truth boxes:

    wget http://csr.bu.edu/ftp/visda17/det/visda18-detection-train.txt
    wget http://csr.bu.edu/ftp/visda17/det/visda18-detection-test.txt
    wget http://csr.bu.edu/ftp/visda17/det/coco17-train.txt
    wget http://csr.bu.edu/ftp/visda17/det/coco17-val.txt

A technical report detailing the data generation process will be released in the near future. 

We suggest using train and val splits of COCO17 as a target validation domain. We provide filtered ground truth for source data in two formats: 

- COCO-like annotations that can be found a single dataset.json file in the root
- `datalist.txt` format with every line following schema `{image_full_name} {class_id1} {xmin1} {ymin1} {xmax1} {ymax1} {class_id2} {xmin2} {ymin2} {xmax2} {ymax2} ... ` i.e. number of bounding boxes can be computed as `(line.split()-1)/5`

## Baselines and Rules

We have several baseline models with data readers in the [`/model`](model) folder. Each model has a short README on how to run it.

- "Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation" (ADDA) with LeNet and VGG16 in Tensorflow [`arxiv`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05464)
- "Learning Transferable Features with Deep Adaptation Networks" (DAN) with Alexnet in Caffe [`arxiv`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.02791)
- "Deep CORAL: Correlation Alignment for Deep Domain Adaptation" with Alexnet in Caffe [`arxiv`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01719)

Please refer to the [challenge rules](http://ai.bu.edu/visda-2017/) for specific guidelines your method must follow.

## Evaluating your Model

We use the standart `IOU@0.5` metric for evaluation. Example evaluation script is avaliable in [`eval.py`](eval.py).

The category IDs are as follows:
> 0 – aeroplane  
> 1 – bicycle  
> 2 – bus  
> 3 – car  
> 4 – horse  
> 5 – knife  
> 6 – motorcycle  
> 7 – person  
> 8 – plant  
> 9 – skateboard  
> 10 – train  
> 11 – truck 
 
Please use the `datalist.txt` format for evaluation, specifically, each submission file should follow schema with *same* order of images as in `coco17-val.txt`: `{image_full_name} {xmin1} {ymin1} {xmax1} {ymax1} {class_id1} {confidence1}...`  

### Evaluation Server and Leaderboards
 
We are using CodaLab to evaluate results and host the leaderboards for this challenge. You can find the detection competition [here](#). Please see the "Evaluation" tab in the competition for more details on leaderboard organization. 

### Feedback and Help
